# GDExtension-Summator

This repository is for showcasing the new GDExtension system that was introduced in Godot 4.
The C++ code is from the [Custom modules example](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/cpp/custom_modules_in_cpp.html "Click to get to the docs") of the Godot docs. 

The officially maintained template can be accessed here: [godot-cpp-template](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp-template)

## :tada: Using the extension
After compiling the extension successfully, you can now use the Summator Class inside Godot
```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
	var s = Summator.new()
	s.add(10)
	s.add(20)
	s.add(30)
	print(s.get_total())
        # outputs 60 in the console
	s.reset()
```

## üî¢ Versioning
This repository is not being updated regularly anymore. It should still work in the newest versions of Godot though.

The releases are structured as ``GODOT_VERSION-EXTENSION_VERSION`` to clarify which version to use for which Godot version.

## ‚ùì What? How? Why?
If you are not sure what each file in this project does or if you want to know in detail: I wrote a blog post about the purpose of each file on [my Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/post/GDExtension--Godot-SUPERCHARGED--How-to-get-star-Z8Z4GLUSE).

## Alternative templates
The official template for GDExtensions is available here: [godot-cpp-template](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp-template). It is well-maintained and was created on the basis of this project here (I am the maintainer of the official template as well) with github action support and a better structured SCons file.

If you want to work with the latest master and godot-cpp version, check out this [GDExtension template by Nathan Franke](https://github.com/nathanfranke/gdextension).
If you are more used to CMake than Scons you can use [this template here by asmalone](https://github.com/asmaloney/GDExtensionTemplate)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building the extension

### VSCode Compilation (only applicable if you are using VSCode as your code editor)
For the initial build you can run the vscode task `initial-build-extension`. This compiles both godot-cpp and the extension. For all subsequent builds, you only need to run the task `build-extension`.

### Debugging via VSCode
To debug your extension you can run the ``build-extension [dev build]`` command. To use this command you need to also modify your specific Godot paths inside the ``.vscode/tasks.json`` file. For further information see [here](https://github.com/paddy-exe/GDExtensionSummator/issues/50).

### Manual Compilation

To compile the extension you need to follow these steps:

0. Click on the green "Use this template" button to generate the repository for you

1. Clone the extension recursively from this repository
```bash
# The git adress can be found under the green "Code" dropdown menu
git clone (--GITHUB ADRESS--) # --recursive to automatically load the submodule godot-cpp
```

2. Make sure you are on the right commit of the godot-cpp repository
```bash
git status # this show's you the commit. Make sure that it has the correct commit for the release you are targeting
```
To make sure you have the right commit, here the [link to the pinned updated issue with the commit hashes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp/issues/874)

3. Make sure you are in the top level of the repository so `pwd` returns the following
```bash
pwd
.../GDExtensionSummator
```

4. Go inside the godot-cpp folder
```bash
cd godot-cpp
```

5. Compile godot-cpp and generate the bindings (only needed once when starting development or when there is an update of the submodule)
```bash
scons # this will use the default values such as target=template_debug
```

6. Go back to the top level of the directory
```bash
cd ..
```

7. Compile the extension
```bash
scons # this will use the default values such as target=template_debug
```
