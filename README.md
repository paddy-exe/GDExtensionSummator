This repository is for showcasing the new GDExtension system in Godot 4.
The C++ code is from the [Custom modules example](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/cpp/custom_modules_in_cpp.html "Click to get to the docs") of the Godot docs.

----> **Feel free to use this repository as a template for your GDExtensions**

## :tada: Using the extension
After compiling the extension succesfully, you can now use the Summator Class inside Godot
```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
	var s = Summator.new()
	s.add(10)
	s.add(20)
	s.add(30)
	print(s.get_total())
        # outputs 60 in the console
	s.reset()
```

## üî¢ Versioning
This repository is being updated regularly to work with the latest beta release of the master (4.0) branch. If you can't compile the extension, please open an issue.

----> **Most Recent Update: Godot 4 Beta 10 working**

## ‚ùì What? How? Why?
If you are not sure what each file in this project does or if you want to know in detail: I wrote a blog post about the purpose of each file on [my Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/post/GDExtension--Godot-SUPERCHARGED--How-to-get-star-Z8Z4GLUSE).

## Alternative templates
If you want to work with the latest master and godot-cpp version, check out this [GDExtension template by Nathan Franke](https://github.com/nathanfranke/gdextension).
If you are more used to CMake than Scons you can use [this template here by asmalone](https://github.com/asmaloney/GDExtensionTemplate)


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Contributing
If you can't compile the extension, please open an issue with the error log in your terminal and/or the error log in the editor (if you can't run the example scene).

PRs for improvements are very welcome!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building the extension

### VSCode Compilation (only applicable if you are using VSCode as your code editor)
For the initial build you can run the vscode task `initial-build-extension`. This compiles both godot-cpp and the extension. For all subsequent builds, you only need to run the task `build-extension`.

### Manual Compilation

To compile the extension you need to follow these steps:

0. Click on the green "Use this template" button to generate the repository for you

1. Clone the extension recursively from this repository
```bash
# --recursive to automatically load the submodule godot-cpp
# The git adress can be found under the green "Code" dropdown menu
git clone --recursive (--GITHUB ADRESS--)
```

2. Make sure you are on the right commit of the godot-cpp repository
```bash
git status
# this show's you the commit. Make sure that it is released to a similar/the same time as the master branch (especially during the beta)
```
To make sure you have the right commit, here the [link to the pinned updated issue with the commit hashes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp/issues/874)

3. Make sure you are in the top level of the repository so `pwd` returns the following
```bash
pwd
.../GDExtensionSummator
```

4. Go inside the godot-cpp folder
```bash
cd godot-cpp
```

5. Compile godot-cpp and generate the bindings (only needed once when starting development or when there is an update of the submodule)
```bash
scons target=template_debug
# OR simpler (the above is the default configuration):
scons 

# For beta 2 and earlier:
scons target=debug generate_bindings=yes
```

6. Go back to the top level of the directory
```bash
cd ..
```

7. Compile the extension
```bash
scons target=template_debug
# OR simpler (the above is the default configuration):
scons

# For beta 2 and earlier:
scons target=debug
```
